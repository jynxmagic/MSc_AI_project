#obstacles are "inflated" to ensure the robot does not bump into them
inflater_layer:
  inflation_radius: 0.3 #inflation radius slighlty larger than the robot itself - robot is 0.2 (20cm) wide
  cost_scaling_factor: 0.2 # low cost scaling factor stops the robot from trying to make a perfect path - robot can move extremely close to obstactles with high scaling
